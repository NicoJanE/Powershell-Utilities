# What 
Runs a Windows command from PowerShell with a countdown timer.

- The related .txt file can specify the command and its arguments.
- The user can enter the countdown duration in seconds (default is 3600 seconds, i.e., one hour).


**My apologies.**  
The previous versions of the script included the shutdown command by default, which wasn't very convenient. That has now been changedâ€”Notepad will open the command.txt file instead.
Sorry again if this caused any trouble for anyone.
